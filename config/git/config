  # pruner: prune everything that is unreachable now.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # This is useful for removing unreachable objects from all places.
  #
  # By [CodeGnome](http://www.codegnome.com/)
  #
  pruner = !"git prune --expire=now; git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --rewrite --all"

  # repacker: repack a repo the way Linus recommends.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # It does the equivalent of "git gc --aggressive"
  # but done *properly*,  which is to do something like:
  #
  #     git repack -a -d --depth=250 --window=250
  #
  # The depth setting is about how deep the delta chains can be;
  # make them longer for old history - it's worth the space overhead.
  #
  # The window setting is about how big an object window we want
  # each delta candidate to scan.
  #
  # And here, you might well want to add the "-f" flag (which is
  # the "drop all old deltas", since you now are actually trying
  # to make sure that this one actually finds good candidates.
  #
  # And then it's going to take forever and a day (ie a "do it overnight"
  # thing). But the end result is that everybody downstream from that
  # repository will get much better packs, without having to spend any effort
  # on it themselves.
  #
  # http://metalinguist.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/the-woes-of-git-gc-aggressive-and-how-git-deltas-work/
  #
  # We also add the --window-memory limit of 1 gig, which helps protect
  # us from a window that has very large objects such as binary blobs.
  #
  repacker = repack -a -d -f --depth=300 --window=300 --window-memory=1g

  # Do everything we can to optimize the repository.
  #
  # This command takes a long time to run, perhaps even overnight.
  #
  # Currently, this command simply calls `git pruner` and `git repacker`.
  # There's a step that may be unnecessarying, calling `git prune-packed`.
